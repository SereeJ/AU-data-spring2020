## Assignment 5

I plan to analyze The Washington Post's Github on the data relating to police shootings that resulted in fatalities. I would first like to examine how wide the disparity ratio is of blacks killed by cops vs whites. I would then like to examine On average how many fatalities were a result of the victim caring a gun.

Using the data provided by The Post, I will be able to break down how the number of fatalities of blacks vs white over the past five years. I can use these numbers to draw out my math to give me the ratios and averages I am looking for. 
 
Something unique to visualize would be the top five weapons often mistaken by police, resulting in a fatality. I can also make charts to show the comparisons of blacks vs whites over the past 5 years. 

To get the conversation started, I plan to reach out to the main contributor to the Washington Post data repository, John Moyskens. *(All of his info can be found on his GitHub)* I can also speak with the department of corrections who has a list/directory of contacts I can reach out to. I can also reach out to Frank Edwards, of Rutgers University’s School of Criminal Justice, Hedwig Lee, of Washington University in St. Louis’s Department of Sociology, and Michael Esposito, of the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research who collectivelly published the August 2019 research article "Risk of being killed by police use of force in the United States by age, race–ethnicity, and sex." Lastly, I can reach out to get opinions from local police stations to compare their records and ideas, as they patrol a predominantly African American community. 

This story is timely because tensions in regards to police brutality in the U.S are at an all-time high, esp in the black community. In the light of movies such as *“When they see us”* by director Ava Duverney, we see conversations being started that is shaking the table to create change. I envision this piece to be an addendum for what has already been said and can help to shed light on new perspectives.
