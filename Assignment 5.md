## Assignment 5

I plan to analyze The Washington Post's Github on the data relating to police shootings that resulted in fatalities. I would first like to examine how wide the disparity ratio is of blacks killed by cops vs whites. I would then like to examine On average how many fatalities were a result of the victim caring a gun.

Using the data provided by The Post, I will be able to break down how the number of fatalities of blacks vs white over the past five years. I can use these numbers to draw out my math to give me the ratios and averages I am looking for. 
 
Something unique to visualize would be the top five weapons often mistaken by police, resulting in a fatality. I can also make charts to show the comparisons of blacks vs whites over the past 5 years. 

To get the conversation started, I plan to reach out to the main contributor to the Washington Post data repository, John Moyskens. *(All of his info can be found on his GitHub)* I can also speak with the department of corrections who has a list/directory of contacts I can reach out to. Lastly, I can reach out to get opinions from local police stations to compare their records and ideas, as they patrol a predominantly African American community. 

This story is timely because tensions in regards to police brutality in the U.S are at an all-time high, esp in the black community. In the light of movies such as *“When they see us”* by director Ava Duverney, we see conversations being started that is shaking the table to create change. I envision this piece to be an addendum for what has already been said and can help to shed light on new perspectives.
