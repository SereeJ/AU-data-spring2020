Topic #1 // **The demand for diversity on the runway** 

### With 2020 seeing the highest rate of diversity on the runway, can we truly say we have entered an inclusive market? 

With all the revolutionary advances being made in the fashion industry, models and audiences alike are raising demands for an increase of diversity on the runway. The break of the 20th century brought the largest number of representation in race, physical disability, gender, and age, but to call todays runway inclusive remains a stretch. 

I want to track the growth and advances of diversity on the runway and its influence in marketing/sales. Research has also been able to pinpoint that progressive brands that represent and market to a diverse crowd are 25% more effective than those trying to portray "the ideal model look."

**When fashion week began for:**
* New York first show for couture [1943]
* Paris began holding couture fashion shows in[ 1973 ]
* Milan [1958] founded by the italian chamber of commerce
* France [ 1984 ] founded under the frensh fashion federation
* London [ 1984 ] founded under the french fashion federation

*Article Critique #1* // **Fall 2019 Runway Diversity Report: Racial and Age Diversity Step Forward, Size and Gender Inclusivity Step Back**

Link to article: [ https://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/828413-diversity-report-fall-2019-runways/ ] 

**Objective:**

The article can be rated a 4 out of five in clarity because it portrayed exactly what it said it would convey. The article speaks on the advances that are being made on the runway in regards to race, gender, age, and weight. I was able to easily navigate through the article as it was well written and segmented in a way that transitioned well for the reader. The framework was built with short paragraphs and strong visuals bringing its quality to a 4 as well. This website is a great source of information but falls short with how far back in time they dig to begin collecting data. 

When it came to the charts and graphics I do believe that they properly displayed and conveyed the growth in diversity for each category separately. They deserve a 5 for graphics as the colors and text were all easy to read and easy on the eye. I would also give them a 5 for creative direction. Choosing to research and shed light on a topic not usually covered in fashion will help brands to recognize how important diversity and inclusion is today.
