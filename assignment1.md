Topic #1 // **The demand for diversity on the runway** 

### With 2020 seeing the highest rate of diversity on the runway, can we truly say we have entered an inclusive market? 

With all the revolutionary advances being made in the fashion industry, models and audiences alike are raising demands for an increase of diversity on the runway. The break of the 20th century brought the largest number of representation in race, physical disability, gender, and age, but to call todays runway inclusive remains a stretch. 

I want to track the growth and advances of diversity on the runway and its influence in marketing/sales. Research has also been able to pinpoint that progressive brands that represent and market to a diverse crowd are 25% more effective than those trying to portray "the ideal model look."

**When fashion week began for:**
* New York first show for couture [1943]
* Paris began holding couture fashion shows in[ 1973 ]
* Milan [1958] founded by the italian chamber of commerce
* France [ 1984 ] founded under the frensh fashion federation
* London [ 1984 ] founded under the french fashion federation

*Article Critique #1* // **Fall 2019 Runway Diversity Report: Racial and Age Diversity Step Forward, Size and Gender Inclusivity Step Back**

Link to article: [ https://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/828413-diversity-report-fall-2019-runways/ ] 

**Objective:**

The article can be rated a 4 out of five in clarity because it portrayed exactly what it said it would convey. The article speaks on the advances that are being made on the runway in regards to race, gender, age, and weight. I was able to easily navigate through the article as it was well written and segmented in a way that transitioned well for the reader. The framework was built with short paragraphs and strong visuals bringing its quality to a 4 as well. This website is a great source of information but falls short with how far back in time they dig to begin collecting data. 

When it came to the charts and graphics I do believe that they properly displayed and conveyed the growth in diversity for each category separately. They deserve a 5 for graphics as the colors and text were all easy to read and easy on the eye. I would also give them a 5 for creative direction. Choosing to research and shed light on a topic not usually covered in fashion will help brands to recognize how important diversity and inclusion is today.

Topic #2 // **Social media and its paradoxical effects on the growth of mental health issues**

### Social Media: can we live with it or without it? 

Major social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TicToc, and Youtube have created a space for individuals to share and connect with friends and family online. As these platforms have become a favorite past time for individuals 13 - 35, research also states that these platforms are to blame for the growing mental health rates we are facing today. 

According to Psych.com scientists and researchers, it is said that social media has a direct effect on mental health that results in anxiety and depression complications. Through hours of endless scrolling, individuals may succumb to the anxieties of : gaining and acquiring likes, Cyber bullying, making life comparisons, trying to decipher real versus fake friends, and spending more time interacting online rather than in person.  

In contrast, studies have also found individuals who do not have a social media platform tend to complain that they suffer the anxieties of “missing out” and being “left out.” They also they that those not connected tend to be less connected to friends and family. Therefore is social media a positive or a negative? I would like to take a deep dive and find what research is out that argues the claims from both angles.

Link 1 // 
Having to draw comparisons bewteen data sets from two articles: 

Mental Health [ https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml ]
Social media [ https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/ ] 

**Objective**

This first link does a great job at conveying the data behind the growth and influx of mental health, broken down by age. The second article communicates the growing use of social media in the rise of Instagram and Facebook era. Both articles have been peer reviewed and are from credible sources making their research trustworthy. For this I will give the accuracy and quality of the information a 5. Both articles have also been published within the past year making it relevant to today. 

The colors and the use of graphs helped to assist the reading and provide visual context. Each graph was broken down appropriately by age, mental disorder, and social media use, bringing its data clarity to a 5.
