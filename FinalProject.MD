## The Nations Capital claims to be the safest place for Blacks in the rise of police fault fatalities - But who keeps a true record? 

*Over the past 5 years, The Washinton Post has made it their duty to conclusively compile data from police agencies and the internet to assemble the most definitive dataset on police fault fatalities. More than three quarters of the data cannot be visually confirmed.* 

African Americans are 2.5 more likely to be killed by police officers than those of other racial backgrounds. According to research done by Washington Post research reporter Julie Tate and her team, this holds true in the majority of the 50 US states, with the exception of Washington D.C - allegedly. 

Most states do a poor job logging data regarding police fault fatalities, as only 144 police departments of the18,000 law enforcement agencies available are currently enrolled in “The Federal Initiative” (that monitors police activities), and more two-thirds of those reports being logged are done without the confirmation of a body camera. Researchers are left to piece together the true happenings of events through data because the actions of the situations cannot be visibly confirmed.

Starting Jan. 1  2015, following the deadly police events of the Micheal Brown, Fergerson Mo. case,  Washington Post research reporters Tate, Jennifer Jenkins, Steven Rich and a team of experts started to dig where most states for years overlooked - police fault fatalities. With tensions high regarding police using deadly force, Washington post reporters compiled an expansive set of data and details pertaining to every fatal police shooting that has occurred in 47 of the largest metros from 2015 until Today. According to The Washington Posts’ recently updated analysis on police shootings, Washington D.C rates the absolute lowest of all 50 states with a rating of 39.4% in fatal police shootings.

The Washington Post does a great job reporting their findings, but one can only wonder how many of the “victims with guns” are alleged, against the number of killings committed out of racial prejudice. With too many holes in the data that is dispersed and scattered about different agencies and locations to draw valid conclusions, The Post began their own assessment on police shootings.

In just five years, The Washington Post has been able to uncover twice as many fatal shootings by police than what is recorded on average annually. Tate explains in her article about data collection that in order to be most accurate, The Post aggregates information from across the internet by “culling local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters.” Aside from these sources, The Washington Post also conducts its own set of additional reporting. 

With the findings, production and presentation journalists at The Post, John Muyskens and team, aggregate all the complied data onto the Washington Post’s Github database “Data-Police-Shootings.” The database details dozens of specifics such as race and hometown of the deceased, the manner in which the fatality occurred, whether the person was armed and the type of item, whether the person was experiencing a mental health crisis, officer names and whether or not the officer was able to capture the incident via body camera.

The majority of the “pushback” The post experiences come when officers and agencies are reluctant to release the data. In 2016, The Post was left with no choice but to threaten that the information regarding police involvement in fatal shootings is released, as it is public record. Agencies have found loopholes in fulfilling the open request, such as denying for reasons of ongoing investigations or saying the data is classified (in which agencies can choose not to disclose). 

“As of 2016, The Post has sent over 1,000 open-records requests to every police department involved in fatal shootings to try to synthesize all the information onto one central database. Only 351 of those reports have come back completely or partially fulfilled, with 102 of them denied and over 579+ requests still pending.”   

The Post collected data in reference to Washington D.C’s tracking of deadly police cases, and have been able to support the claim that blacks have been shot almost twice as high as their percentage of their overall U.S population. According to July 1, 2019, the US census bureau concluded that blacks make up about 13 percent of the U.S population while The Post concludes that blacks make up 23 percent of those fatally shot by police since 2015. 

In 2016 the data took a shift. Reports came back that the US is experiencing a slight decline in fatal deaths of police officers on unarmed black persons. With the new trend more whites than blacks were being killed as police killed 22 unarmed whites and 19 unarmed blacks in 2017. Over the past four years, the trend remains true but data scientists warn us not to title this too seriously nor take it as a win. The increments are so small that scientists are predicting it could be a mere coincidence or chance.

With tensions high, police are most likely to shoot only if the victim is also carrying a gun. Today, to minimize the degree in which police fault fatalities occur, police chiefs and training experts are implementing more-restrictive rules on when to “give chase,” according to D.C police officer Lloyd Azel. He said that ‘getting involved in high-risk situations not only tends to inject the situation with more adrenaline -- but it’s best to keep your distance unless you see something serious about to happen. That’s when it’s time to intervene.’  

DC officers claim that taking a more laid back approach to how they disengage intense situations may be the solution in reducing police-involved killings. Until more police-body cameras are put into effect, the data and the testimonies of the parties involved are all reporters have to confirm the true happenings of police fault shootings.
