Taking a deep dive into the data provided by FEC.gov, I wanted to focus on which candidates in the 2020 primaries are the residents of my current hometown, Monroe Township, financially supporting — between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.  

After searching through the FEC website with a focus 2019-present day and the the area code set to ‘08831,’ I was able to find all of the democratic and republican donations made in support to both parties. However, what I found most interesting was that the largest pool of donations came from individuals who were either Unemployed or Retired. This led me to question who is truly driving the elections — the employed or unemployed? I would also like to know how, or if, that affects the results and in what ways. 

1. I Used the FEC.gov website to pinpoint my data
2. I Used the 'committee name’ drop-down tab on the top header and the 'contributor occupation’ drop-down to filter through the different committee names and member occupations.
3. I had to clean the data set to make sure all the 'NOT EMPLOYED’ boxes were all under the same text and category. 
* Cleaning the data set: 
  * If Nonemployed replace with NOT EMPLOYED
  * Used the counter and the summation formulas to quickly calculate column totals

*I also created a table to start reporting my findings in order to draw a solid hypothesis.*
